The Victorian era (1837-1901) was a golden age for children's literature. Popular themes included moral lessons, fantasy adventures, and coming-of-age stories. Authors like Charles Dickens, George MacDonald, and Lewis Carroll revolutionized how children's stories were written. Victorian children's books often featured protagonists who learned important life lessons through fantastical adventures. The era emphasized the importance of imagination while still maintaining moral instruction. Social criticism was often woven into these tales, addressing issues like class inequality and the rigid social structures of the time.
