Lewis Carroll was born Charles Dodgson in 1832 in Daresbury, Cheshire, England. He was a mathematician, photographer, and writer who taught at Oxford University. Carroll was known for his logical mind and love of wordplay, which influenced his literary works. He was also an early pioneer in photography and took many portraits of children. Despite his fame as a children's author, he was quite shy in person and preferred the company of children to adults. He died in 1898 at the age of 65.
