Mathematical logic and wordplay are central themes in Carroll's works. He often used puns, riddles, and logical paradoxes to create humor and meaning. The story structure follows dream logic rather than realistic causality. Carroll's background in mathematics influenced his approach to nonsense - even the absurd follows certain rules. The narrative explores concepts of identity, transformation, and the nature of reality. Symbolic elements include the rabbit hole as a metaphor for entering the unconscious mind, playing cards representing social hierarchy, and the constant size changes reflecting the instability of childhood identity.
