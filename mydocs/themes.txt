Alice in Wonderland explores several important themes:

Growing up and identity: Alice's constant size changes reflect the confusion and instability of growing up. She questions who she is throughout her journey.

Logic vs nonsense: The story contrasts rational thinking with the absurd logic of Wonderland, showing how different systems of reasoning can coexist.

Authority and rebellion: Alice frequently challenges authority figures like the Queen of Hearts, representing a child's natural tendency to question adult rules.

Dreams vs reality: The entire adventure has a dreamlike quality that blurs the line between what is real and what is imagined.

Victorian social criticism: Carroll satirizes the rigid social conventions, educational systems, and class structures of Victorian England through the absurd characters and situations in Wonderland.
