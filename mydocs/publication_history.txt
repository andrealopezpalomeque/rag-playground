Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was first published in 1865 by Macmillan Publishers. The book was originally titled "Alice's Adventures Under Ground" and was written as a gift for Alice Liddell. Carroll expanded the original manuscript after friends encouraged him to publish it. The first edition featured illustrations by John Tenniel, which became iconic. The book was an immediate success and has never been out of print. It has been translated into over 170 languages and adapted countless times for stage, film, and television. The sequel, "Through the Looking-Glass," was published in 1871.
